# Digital-Electronics-project
This is a project which mainly includes logisim and Verilog code for automated entry and exit of vehicles in parking system which is done on a very small scale but can be applied on a larger scale


The problems related to vehicle parking in flats ,apartments, offices etc.,  includes
•	Reserved parking slots used by outsiders which pose problems to actual residents.
•	Theft and damage(theft of petrol in two wheelers) to vehicles .

Our project aims at overcoming above problems by the idea of automated entry and exit of vehicles(in a small scale(10 vehicles) which can be expanded to large scale) .
•	Unique password will be given to each vehicle owned by the residents which works for both entry and exit.
•	Keep the count of two wheelers and four wheelers separately at any instant of time.
•	Separate entry for two and four wheelers.
Components used:
1.	Basic(and ,or, not) and universal logic gates( nand , nor)
2.	Encoders
3.	Counters(flipflops)
4.	Buzzer(resistors, capacitor, switch, voltage source,555 timer)--implemented in hardware
5.	Since Buzzer cannot be implemented using logisim and verilog we have implemented it in hardware.
