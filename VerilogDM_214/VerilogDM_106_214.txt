Since 2 wheelers and 4 wheelers entry and exit depends on the password which is different for both 2 wheelers(3 bit decimal password) and 4 wheelers(5 bit decimal password),
*Same test bench cannot be made and hence each has different test bench and verilog codes


#Verilog code for Behavioral modelling of 
	2  wheelers has the name VerilogDM_106_214(2w_entry).v----for entry in the parking slot which include the test bench in itself
			      VerilogDM_106_214(2w_exit).v----for exiting  the parking slot which include the test bench in itself
			      vcd file as VerilogDM_106_214_2w_entry.vcd and VerilogDM_106_214_2w_exit.vcd 


	4  wheelers has the name VerilogDM_106_214(4w_entry).v----for entry in the parking slot which include the test bench in itself
			      VerilogDM_106_214(4w_exit).v----for exiting  the parking slot which include the test bench in itself
			      vcd file as VerilogDM_106_214_4w_entry.vcd and VerilogDM_106_214_4w_exit.vcd
